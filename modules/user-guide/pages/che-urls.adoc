= {prod-short} URLs

Working with {prod-short} involves regular interaction with the following URLs:

* URL of your organization's {prod-short} instance
* URL of the *Workspaces* page of your {prod-short} dashboard
* URLs for starting a new workspace
* URLs of your workspaces

== URL of your organization's {prod-short} instance

Your {prod-short} administrator must provide you with the URL of your organization's {prod-short} instance that you need as a user to access your {prod-short} dashboard and start and manage your workspaces. This URL is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN):

[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
{prod-url}
----

== URL of the *Workspaces* page your {prod-short} dashboard

The *Workspaces* page of your {prod-short} dashboard is where you manage your workspaces and verify their current states. The URL syntax for this page is like so:

[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
{prod-url}/dashboard/#/workspaces
----

== URLs for starting a new workspace

For every remote Git repository that you plan to use inside a workspace, you need a URL with the following syntax:
[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
{prod-url}#__<git_repository_url>__
----

Visiting this URL in a browser tab starts a new workspace that contains a clone of that repository.
